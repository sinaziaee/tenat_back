chips
let
s
start
at
the
beginning
the
manufacture
of
a
chip
begins
with
silicon
a
silicon
a
natural
element
substance
found
in
sand
because
silicon
does
not
conduct
electricity
well
it
is
which
is
a
semiconductor
called
a
semiconductor
with
a
special
chemical
process
it
is
possible
to
add
semiconductor
a
substance
materials
to
silicon
that
allow
tiny
areas
to
transform
into
one
of
three
devices
that
does
not
conduct
electricity
well
•
excellent
conductors
of
electricity
using
either
microscopic
copper
or
alu
minum
wire
•
excellent
insulators
from
electricity
like
plastic
sheathing
or
glass
•
areas
that
can
conduct
or
insulate
under
special
conditions
as
a
switch
transistors
fall
in
the
last
category
a
vlsi
circuit
then
is
just
billions
of
combi
nations
of
conductors
insulators
and
switches
manufactured
in
a
single
small
package
the
manufacturing
process
for
integrated
circuits
is
critical
to
the
cost
of
the
chips
and
hence
important
to
computer
designers
figure
shows
that
process
the
process
starts
with
a
silicon
crystal
ingot
which
looks
like
a
giant
sausage
silicon
crystal
ingot
a
rod
today
ingots
are
inches
in
diameter
and
about
inches
long
an
ingot
composed
ofa
silicon
crystal
that
is
between
and
inches
is
finely
sliced
into
wafers
no
more
than
0
inch
thick
these
wafers
then
go
in
diameter
and
about
to
through
a
series
of
processing
steps
during
which
patterns
of
chemicals
are
placed
