under
the
covers
although
hard
drives
are
not
removable
there
are
several
storage
technologies
in
use
that
include
the
following
•
optical
disks
including
both
compact
disks
cds
and
digital
video
disks
dvds
constitute
the
most
common
form
of
removable
storage
•
magnetic
tape
provides
only
slow
serial
access
and
has
been
used
to
back
up
disks
in
a
role
now
often
replaced
by
duplicate
hard
drives
•
flash
based
removable
memory
cards
typically
attach
by
a
usb
universal
serial
bus
connection
and
are
often
used
to
transfer
files
•
floppy
drives
and
zip
drives
are
a
version
of
magnetic
disk
technology
with
removable
flexible
disks
floppydisks
were
the
original
primary
storage
for
floppy
disk
a
portable
form
of
personal
computers
but
have
now
largely
vanished

coated
optical
disk
technology
works
in
a
completely
different
way
than
magnetic
disk
with
a
magnetic
recording
technology
in
a
cd
data
is
recorded
in
a
spiral
fashion
with
individual
bits
being
material
recorded
by
burning
small
pits
approximately
i
micron
0
meters
in
diame
into
the
disk
surface
the
disk
is
read
by
shining
a
laser
at
the
cd
surface
and
determining
by
examining
the
reflected
light
whether
there
is
a
pit
or
flat
reflec
tive
surface
dvds
use
the
same
approach
of
bouncing
a
laser
beam
off
a
series
of
pits
and
flat
surfaces
in
addition
there
are
multiple
layers
that
the
laser
beam
can
be
focused
on
and
the
size
of
each
bit
is
much
smaller
which
together
yield
a
sig
nificant
increase
in
capacity
cd
and
dvd
writers
in
personal
computers
use
a
laser
to
make
the
pits
in
the
recording
layer
on
the
cd
or
dvd
surface
this
writing
process
is
relatively
slow
taking
from
tens
of
minutes
for
a
full
cd
to
close
to
an
hour
for
a
full
dvd
thus
for
large
quantities
a
different
technique
called
pressing
is
used
which
costs
only
pennies
per
cd
or
dvd
rewritable
cds
and
dvds
use
a
different
recording
surface
that
has
a
crystal
line
reflective
material
pits
are
formed
that
are
not
reflective
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
for
a
write
once
cd
or
dvd
to
erase
the
cd
or
dvd
the
surface
is
heated
and
cooled
slowly
allowing
an
annealing
process
to
restore
the
surface
recording
layer
to
its
crystalline
structure
these
rewritable
disks
are
the
most
expensive
with
write

being
cheaper
for
read
only
disks
used
to
distribute

re

or

both
the
disk
cost
and
recording
cost
are
much
lower
