mounted
on

of
its
heat
sink
which
is
designed
to
remove
the
watts
generated
within
the
die
power
can
be
reduced
by
lowering
the
voltage
which
typically
occurs
with

have
gone
from

significantly
reducing
power
the
capacitive
load
per
transistor
is
a
function
of
both
the
number
of
transistors
connected
to
an
output
called
the
fanout
and
the
technology
which
deter
mines
the
capacitance
of
both
wires
and
transistors
although
dynamic
power
is
the
primary
source
of
power
dissipation
in
cmos
static
power
dissipation
occurs
because
of
leakage
current
that
flows
even
when
a
transistor
is
off
in

leakage
is
probably
responsible
for
0
0
of
the
power
consumption
thus
increasing
the
number
of
transistors
increases
power
dissipation
even
if
the
transistors
are
always
off
a
variety
of
design
techniques
and
technology
innovations
have
been
deployed
to
control
leakage
