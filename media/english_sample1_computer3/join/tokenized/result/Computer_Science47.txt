ftgure
an
nch
0~m
diameter
wafer
containing
intel
pentium
processors
the
number
of
pentium
dies
per
wafer
at
00
yield
is
figure
on
page
is
a
photomicrograph
of
one
of
these
pentiwli
dies
the
die
area
is
0
mm
and
it
contains
about
miuion
transistors
this
die
uses
a
0
micron
technology
which
means
that
the
smallest
transistors
are
approximately
0
microns
in
size
although
they
are
typically
somewhat
smaller
than
the
actual
feature
size
which
refers
to
the
size
ofthe
transistors
as
~drawn
versus
the
final
manufactured
size
the
pentium
is
also
made
using
a
more
advanced
0
micron
technology
the
several
dozen
partially
rounded
chips
at
the
bowldaries
of
the
wafer
are
useless
they
are
included
becau
ie
it
s
easier
to
create
the
masks
used
to
pattern
the
silicon
compared
to
the
watts
consumed
by
the
pentium
as
we
will
see
in
later
chap
ters
both
performance
and
power
consumption
vary
widely
elaboration
in
cmos
complementary
metal
oxide
semiconductor
which
is
the
dominant
technology
for
integrated
circuits
the
primary
source
of
power
dissipation
is
so
called
dynamic
power
that
is
power
that
is
consumed
during
switching
cmos
technology
unlike
earlier
technologies
does
not
directly
consume
power
when
it
is
idle
hence
the
use
of
low
clock
rates
to
allow
a
processor
to
sleep
and
conserve
power
the
dynamic
power
dissipation
depends
on
the
capacitive
loading
of
each
tran
sistor
the
voltage
applied
and
the
frequency
that
the
transistor
is
switched
