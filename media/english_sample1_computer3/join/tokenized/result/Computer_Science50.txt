performance
increase
of
workstations

here
performance
is
given
as
approximately
the
number
of
times
faster
than
the
vax
ii
0
which
was
a
commonly
used
yardstick
the
rate
of
performance
improvement
is
between
and
times
per
year
these
performance
numbers
are
based
on
specint
performance
see
chapter
and
scaled
over
time
to
deal
with
changing
benchmark
sets
for
processors
listed

performance
growth
rate

the
industry
will
yield
machines
with
the
same
performance
for
example
assuming
a

yearly
growth
rate
in
performance
a

to

x
in
three
years
your
machine
would
have
no
performance
advantage
many
projects
within
computer
companies
are
canceled
either
because
they
ignore
this
rule
or
because
the
project
is
completed
late
and
the
performance
of
the
delayed
machine
is
below
the
industry
average
this
phenomenon
may
occur
in
any
industry
but
rapid
improvements
in
cost
performan
ce
make
it
a
major
concern
in
the
computer
industry
