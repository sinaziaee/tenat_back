computer
abstractions
and
technology
on
each
wafer
creating
the
transistors
conductors
and
insulators
discussed
ear
lier
today
s
integrated
circuits
contain
only
one
layer
of
transistors
but
may
have
from
two
to
eight
levels
of
metal
conductor
separated
by
layers
of
insulators
a
single
microscopic
flaw
in
the
wafer
itself
or
in
one
of
the
dozens
of
pattern
defect
a
microscopic
flaw
in
a
ing
steps
can
result
in
that
area
of
the
wafer
failing
these
defects
as
they
are
wafer
or
in
patterning
steps
that
called
make
it
virnlally
impossible
to
mallufacnlre
a
perfect
wafer
to
cope
with
can
result
in
the
failure
ofthe
imperfection
several
strategies
have
been
used
but
the
simplest
is
to
place
many
die
containing
that
defect
independent
components
on
a
single
wafer
the
patterned
wafer
is
then
chopped
up
or
diced
into
these
components
called
dies
and
more
informally
known
as
die
the
individual
rectangular
sections
that
are
cut
from
a
chips

of
a
wafer
containing

more
informally
known
sors
before
they
have
been
diced
earlier

vidual
die
of
the
pentium
and
its
major
components
dicing
enables
you
to
discard
only
those
dies
that
were
unlucky
enough
to
con
yield
the
percentage
of
good
tain
the
flaws
rather
than
the
whole
wafer
this
concept
is
quantified
by
the
yield
dies
from
the
total
number
of
of
a
process
which
is
defined
as
the
percentage
of
good
dies
from
the
total
number
dies
on
the
wafer
of
dies
on
the
wafer
the
cost
of
all
integrated
circuit
rises
quickly
as
the
die
size
increases
due
both
to
the
lower
yield
and
the
smaller
number
of
large
dies
that
fit
on
a
wafer
to
reduce
the
cost
a
large
die
is
often
shrunk
by
using
the
next
generation
process
which
incorporates
smaller
sizes
for
both
transistors
and
wires
this
improves
the
yield
and
the
die
count

wafer

these
issues
further
once
you
ve
found
good
dies
they
are
connected
to
the
input
output
pins
of
a
package
using
a
process
called
bonding
these
packaged
parts
are
tested
a
fin
al
time
since
mistakes
can
occur
in
packaging
and
then
they
are
shipped
to
cus
tomers
another
increasingly
important
design
constraint
is
power
power
is
a
chal
lenge
for
two
reasons
first
power
must
be
brought
in
alld
distributed
around
the
chip
modern
microprocessors
use
hundreds
of
pins
just
for
power
and
ground
similarly
multiple
levels
of
interconnect
are
used
solely
for
power
and
ground
dis
tribution
to
portions
of
the
chip
second
power
is
dissipated
as
heat
and
must
be
removed
an
intel
pentium
at
0
ghz
burns
watts
which
must
be
removed
from
a
chip
whose
surface
area
is
just
over
i
cm
figure
shows
a
0
ghz
pentium
mounted
on
top
of
its
heat
sink
which
in
turn
sits
right
next
to
the
fan
in
the
box
shown
in
figure
on
page
what
determines
the
power
consumed
by
all
integrated
circuit
ignoring
tech
nology
and
circuit
specifics
the
power
is
proportional
to
the
product
of
the
num
ber
of
transistors
switched
times
the
frequency
they
are
switched
thus
in
general
higher
clock
rates
or
higher
transistor
counts
lead
to
higller
power
for
example
the
intel
itanium
has
four
times
the
transistors
of
the
intel
pentium
althougll
its
clock
rate
is
only
one
half
that
of
the
pentium
the
itanium
burns
0
watts
