to

how
the

used

throughout
the
book
with
the
first

appearing
below
these
elements
summarize
important
insights
into
program
performance
understanding
the
performance
of
a
program
depends
on
a
combination
of
the
effectiveness
of
the
algorithms
used
in
the
program
the
software
systems
used
to
create
and
trans
program
late
the
program
into
machine
instructions
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
computer
performance
in
executing
those
instructions
which
may
include
i
o
operations
the
following

how
the

the
material
i

showed
that
the
number
of
embedded
processors
sold
every

greatly
outnumbers
the
number

processors
can
you
con
firm
or
deny
this
insight
based
on
your
own
experience
try
to
count
the
number
of
embedded

in
your

how

in
