computer
abstractions
and
technology
the
power
of
computing
by
including
communication
networks
have
become
so
popular
that
they
are
the
backbone
of
current
computer
systems
a
new
machine
without
an
optional
network
interface
would
be
ridiculed
networked
computers
have
several
major
adva
ntages
•
comm
unication
information
is
exchanged
between
computers
at
high
speeds
•
resource
sharing
rather
than
each
machine
having
its
own
i
o
devices
devices
can
be
shared
by
computers
on
the
network
•
non
ocal
access
by
connecting
computers
over
long
distances
users
need
not
be
near
the
computer
they
are
using
networks
vary
in
length
and
performance
with
the
cost
of
communication
increasing
according
to
both
the
speed
of
communication
and
the
distance
that
information
travels
perhaps
the
most
popular
type
of
network
is
the
ethernet
its
length
is
limited
to
about
a
kilometer
and
the
most
popular
version
in
00
takes
about
a
tenth
of
a
second
to
send
million
bytes
of
data
its
length
and
speed
make
ethernet
useful
to
connect
computers
on
the
same
floor
of
a
building

network

a
hence
it
is
an
example
of
what
is
generically
called
a
local
area
network
local
network
designed
to
carry
data
area
networks
are
interconnected
with
switches
that
can
also
provide
routing

wide

networks
cross
continents
and
are
the
backbone
of

supports

they
are
typically
based
on
building
optical

and
are

network
networks
have
changed
the
face
of
computing
in
the
last
years
both
by
extended
over
hundreds
ofkilo
becoming
much
more
ubiquitous
and
by
dramatic
increases
in
perfo
rmance
in
meters
which
can
span
a
conti
the
0s
very
few
individuals
had
access
to
electronic
mail
the
internet
and
web
nent
did
not
exist
and
physically
mailing
magnetic
tapes
was
the
primary
way
to
trans
fer
large
amounts
of
data
between
two
locations
in
the
0s
local
area
networks
were
almost
nonexistent
and
the
few
existing
wide
area
networks
had
limited
capacity
and
restricted
access
as
networking
technology
improved
it
became
much
cheaper
and
had
a
much
higher
capacity
for
example
the
first
standardized
local
area
network
technology
developed
about
years
ago
was
a
version
of
ethernet
that
had
a
maximum
capacity
also
called
bandwidth
of
0
million
bits
per
second
typically
shared
by
tens
if
not
a
hundred
computers
today
local
area
network
technology
offers
a
capacity
of
from
00
million
bits
per
second
to
a
gigabit
per
second
usually
shared
by
at
most
a
few
computers
furthermore
lo
gigabit
technology
is
in
development
optical
communications
technology
has
allowed
similar
growth
in
the
capacity
of
wide
area
networks
from
hundreds
of
kilobits
to
gigabits
and
from
hundreds
of
computers
connected
to
a
worldwide
network
to
millions
of
com
put

combination
of
dramatic
rise
in
