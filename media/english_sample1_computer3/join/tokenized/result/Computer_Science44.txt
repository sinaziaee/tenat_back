this

estimate
was
called
the

growth
rule
in
recent
years
the
rate
has
slowed
down
somewhat
and
is
somewhat
closer
to
doubling
every
two
years
or
four
times
every
four

millions
the
adjective
very

is
added
to
the
term
creating
the

this
rate

has
been
remarkably
stable
figure
taining

shows
the
growth
in
dram
capacity
since
for

years
the
industry
has
to
millions
oftransistors
consistently
quadrupled
capacity
every
years
resulting
in
atl
increase
in

of

times
this
increase
in
transistor
count
for
an
integrated
circuit
is
popu
larly
known
as
moore
s
law
which
states
that
transistor
capacity
doubles
every
months
moore
s
law
resulted
from
a
prediction
of
such
growth
in
ic
capacity
made
by
gordon

of
the
founders
of

it
would

we
d
be

to
get
as

finally
got
