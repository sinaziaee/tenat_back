fallacies
and
pitfalls
a
key
factor
in
determining
the
cost
of
an
integrated
circuit
is
volume
\vhich
of
check
the
following
are
reasons
why
a
chip
made
in
high
volume
should
cost
less
yourself
with
high
volumes
the
manufacturing
process
can
be
tuned
to
a
particular
design
increasing
the
yield
it
is
less
work
to
design
a
high
volume
part
than
a
low
volume
part
the
masks
used
to
make
the
chip
are
expensive
so
the
cost
per
chip
is
lower
for
higher
volumes
engineering
development
costs
are
high
and
largely
independent
of
vol
ume
thus
the
development
cost
per
die
is
lower
with
high
volume
parts
high
volume
parts
usually
have
smaller
die
sizes
than
low
volume
parts
and
therefore
have
higher
yield

wafer

the

of
a
section
on
fallacies

which
will
be
found
in
every

is
to
explain
some
commonly
held
misconceptions
that
you
might
encounter
we
call
such
misbeliefs
fallacies
when
discussing
a
fallacy
we
try
to
give
a
counterexample
we
also
discuss

the
pur

of
these
sections
is
to

you
avoid
