chapter computer abstraction and technology figure a simplified view of hardware and software a hierarchical layer shown a concentric circle with hardware in the center and application software outermost in complex application there are often multiple layer of application software a weu for example a database system may run on top of the system software hosting an application which in turn nm on top of the database can execute given the sophistication of modern programming language and the simple instruction executed by the hardware the translation from a high level language program to hardwa re instruction is complex we will give a brief over view of the process and return to the subject in chapter from a high level language to the language of hardware to actually speak to an electronic machine you need to send electrical signal the easiest signal fo r machine to understand are on and off and so the machine alphabet is just two letter just a the letter of the english alphabet do not limit how much ca n be written the two letter of the computer alphabet do not limit what computer can do the two symbol for these two letter are the num bers 0 and and we commonly think of the machine language a number in base binary digit also called a bit or binary nllmbers we refer to each letter a a binary digit or bit computer one of the two number in base are slave to our command which are called instruction instruction which are 0 or that are the compo just collection of bit that the computer understands can be thought of a num nents of information bers for example the bit 000 00 0 00000 tell one computer to add two number chapter explains why we use number for instruction and data we don t want to steal that chapter s thunder but using number for both instruction and data is a foundation of computing
