chapter computer abstraction and technology or persollal digital assistant the computer in a video game or digital television and the network of processor that control a modern airplane or cargo ship embedded computing system are designed to run one application or one set of related application which is normally integrated with the hardware and delivered a a single system thus despite the large number of embedded computer most user never really see that they are using a computer embedded application often have unique application requirement that com bine a minimum performance with stringent limitation on cost or power for example consider a cell phone the processor need only be a fast a necessary to handle it limited function and beyond that minimizing cost and power are the most important objective despite their low cost embedded computer often have the least tolera nce for fa ilure since the result ca n vary from upsetting when your new television crash to devastating such a might occur when the com puter in a plane or car crash in consumer oriented embedded application such a a digital home appliance dependability is achieved primarily through simplicity the emphasis is on doing one function a perfectly a possible in large embedded system technique of redundancy which are used in server are often employed although this book focus on general purpose computer most of the concept apply directly or with slight modification to embedded comput er in several place we will touch on some of the unique aspect of embedded computer figure show that during the last several year the growth in the number of embedded computer ha been much faster 0 compounded annual growth rate than the growth rate among desktop computer and server annually note that the embedded computer include cell phone video garnes digital tv and set top box personal digital assistant and a variety of such consumer device note that this data doe not include low end embedded control device that use bit and bit processor elaboration elaboration are short section used throughout the text to provide more detail on a particular subject which may be of interest disinterested reader may skip over an elaboration since the subsequent material will never depend on the content of the elaboration many embedded processor are designed using processor core a version of a pro cessor written in a hardware description language such a verilog or vhdl the core allows a designer to integrate other application specific hardware with the processor core for fabrication on a single chip the availability of synthesis tool that can gener ate a chip from a verilog specification together with the capacity of modern silicon chip ha made such special purpose processor highly attractive since the core can be synthesized for different semiconductor manufacturing line using a core provides flexibility in choosing a manufacturer a well in the last few year the use of core ha
