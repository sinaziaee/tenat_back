introduction class of computing application and their characteristic although a common set of hardware technology discussed in section and is used in computer ranging from smart home appliance to cell phone to the largest supercomputer these different application have different design requirement and employ the core hardware technology in different way broadly speaking computer are used in three different class of application desktop computer are possibly the best known form of computing and are desktop computer a com characterized by the personal computer which most reader of this book have puter designed for use by an individual usually incorporat probably used extensively desktop computer emphasize delivering good perfor inga graphic display keyboard mance to a single user at low cost and usually are used to execute third party soft and mouse ware also called shrink wrap software desktop computing is one of the largest market for computer and the evolution of many computing technology is driven by this class of computing which is only about 0 year old server are the modern form of what wa once mainframe minicomputer server a computer used for and supercomputer and are usually accessed only via a network server are ori running larger program for ented to carrying large workload which may consist of either single complex multiple user often simulta neously and typically accessed application usually a scientific or engineering application or handling many only via a network small job such a would occur in building a large web server these application are often based on software from another source such a a database or simulation system but are often modified or customized for a particular function server are built from the same basic technology a desktop computer but provide for greater expa ndability of both computing and input output capacity a we will see in the chapter the performance of a server can be measured in several different way depending on the application of interest in general server also place a greater emphasis on dependability since a crash is usually more costly than it would be on a single user desktop computer server span the widest range in cost and capability at the low end a server supercomputer a class of computer with the highest per may be little more than a desktop machine without a screen or keyboard and with formance and cost they are a cost of a thousand dollar these low end server are typically used for file stor configured a server and typi age small business application or simple web serving at the other extreme are cally cost million ofdollars supercomputer which at the present consist of hundred to thousand of pro terabyte originally cessors and usually gigabyte to terabyte of memory and terabyte to petabyte 0 0 byte of storage and cost million to hundred of million of dollar supercomputer although some communication are usually used for high end scientific and engineering calculation such a and secondary storage system weather forecasting oil exploration protein structure determination and other have redefined it to mean large scale problem although such supercomputer represent the peak of com 000 000 000 000 0 byte puting capability they are a relatively small fraction of the server and a relatively embedded computer a com small fraction of the overall computer market in term of total revenue puter inside another device used embedded computer are the largest class of computer and span the widest for rulming one predetermined range of application and performance embedded computer include the micro application or collection ofsoft processor found in your washing machine and car the computer in a cell phone ware
