below your program a mentioned earlier both the software and hardwa re affect the perfor mance of a program can you think of example where each of the follow ing is the right place to look for a performance bottleneck • the algorithm chosen • the programming language or compiler • the operating system • the processor • the i o system and device in paris they simply stared when spoke to them in below your program french i never did succeed in making those idiot understand their own lan a typical application such a a word processor or a large database system may guage consist of hundred of thousand to million of line of code and rely on sophisti mark twain the llllloeellts cated software library that implement complex fun ctions in support of the abroad application a we will see the hardware in a computer can only execute extremely simple low level instruction to go from a complex application to the simple instruction involves several layer of software that interpret or translate high level operation into simple computer instruction these layer of software are organized primarily in a hierarchical fashion with application being the outermost ring and a variety of system software sitting system software software that provides service that are between the hardwa re and application softwa re a shown in figure commonly useful including there are many type of system software but two type of system software are operating system compiler central to every computer system today an operating system and a compiler an and assembler operating system interface between a user s program and the hardware and pro operating system supervising vides a variety of service and supervisory function among the most important program that manages the function are resource ofa computer for the • handling basic input and output operation benefit ofthe program that run on that machine • allocating storage and memory • providing for sharing the computer among multiple application using it simultaneously compiler a program that example of operating system in use today are window linux and macos translates high level language compiler perform another vital function the translation of a program writ statement into assembly ten in a high level language such a c or java into instruction that the hardwa re language statement
