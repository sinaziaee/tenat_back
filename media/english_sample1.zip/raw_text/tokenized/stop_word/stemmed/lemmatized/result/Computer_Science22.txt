chapter computer abstractions and technology or persollal digital assistant the computers in a video game or digital television and the networks of processors that control a modern airplane or cargo ship embedded computing systems are designed to run one application or one set of related applications which is normally integrated with the hardware and delivered as a single system thus despite the large number of embedded computers most users never really see that they are using a computer embedded applications often have unique application requirements that com bine a minimum performance with stringent limitations on cost or power for example consider a cell phone the processor need only be as fast as necessary to handle its limited function and beyond that minimizing cost and power are the most important objectives despite their low cost embedded computers often have the least tolera nce for fa ilure since the results ca n vary from upsetting when your new television crashes to devastating such as might occur when the com puter in a plane or car crashes in consumer oriented embedded applications such as a digital home appliance dependability is achieved primarily through simplicity the emphasis is on doing one function as perfectly as possible in large embedded systems techniques of redundancy which are used in servers are often employed although this book focuses on general purpose computers most of the concepts apply directly or with slight modifications to embedded comput ers in several places we will touch on some of the unique aspects of embedded computers figure shows that during the last several years the growth in the number of embedded computers has been much faster 0 compounded annual growth rate than the growth rate among desktop computers and servers annually note that the embedded computers include cell phones video garnes digital tvs and set top boxes personal digital assistants and a variety of such consumer devices note that this data does not include low end embedded control devices that use bit and bit processors elaboration elaborations are short sections used throughout the text to provide more detail on a particular subject which may be of interest disinterested readers may skip over an elaboration since the subsequent material will never depend on the contents of the elaboration many embedded processors are designed using processor cores a version of a pro cessor written in a hardware description language such as verilog or vhdl the core allows a designer to integrate other application specific hardware with the processor core for fabrication on a single chip the availability of synthesis tools that can gener ate a chip from a verilog specification together with the capacity of modern silicon chips has made such special purpose processors highly attractive since the core can be synthesized for different semiconductor manufacturing lines using a core provides flexibility in choosing a manufacturer as well in the last few years the use of cores has
