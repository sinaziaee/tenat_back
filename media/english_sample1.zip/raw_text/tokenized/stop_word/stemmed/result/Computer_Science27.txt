below your program as mentioned earlier both the software and hardwa re affect the perfor mance of a program can you think of examples where each of the follow ing is the right place to look for a performance bottleneck • the algorithm chosen • the programming language or compiler • the operating system • the processor • the i o system and devices in paris they simply stared when spoke to them in below your program french i never did succeed in making those idiots understand their own lan a typical application such as a word processor or a large database system may guage consist of hundreds of thousands to millions of lines of code and rely on sophisti mark twain the llllloeellts cated software libraries that implement complex fun ctions in support of the abroad application as we will see the hardware in a computer can only execute extremely simple low level instructions to go from a complex application to the simple instructions involves several layers of software that interpret or translate high level operations into simple computer instructions these layers of software are organized primarily in a hierarchical fashion with applications being the outermost ring and a variety of systems software sitting systems software software that provides services that are between the hardwa re and applications softwa re as shown in figure commonly useful including there are many types of systems software but two types of systems software are operating systems compilers central to every computer system today an operating system and a compiler an and assemblers operating system interfaces between a user s program and the hardware and pro operating system supervising vides a variety of services and supervisory functions among the most important program that manages the functions are resources ofa computer for the • handling basic input and output operations benefit ofthe programs that run on that machine • allocating storage and memory • providing for sharing the computer among multiple applications using it simultaneously compiler a program that examples of operating systems in use today are windows linux and macos translates high level language compilers perform another vital function the translation of a program writ statements into assembly ten in a high level language such as c or java into instructions that the hardwa re language statements
