classes
of
computing
applications
and
their
characteristics
although
a
common
set
of
hardware
technologies
discussed
in
sections
and
is
used
in
computers
ranging
from
smart
home
appliances
to
cell
phones
to
the
largest
supercomputers
these
different
applications
have
different
design
requirements
and
employ
the
core
hardware
technologies
in
different
ways
broadly
speaking
computers
are
used
in
three
different
classes
of
applications
desktop
computers
are
possibly
the
best
known
form
of
computing
and
are
desktop

com
characterized
by
the
personal
computer
which
most
readers
of
this
book
have
puter
designed
for
use
by
an
individual
usually
incorporat
probably
used
extensively
desktop
computers
emphasize
delivering
good

inga
graphics
display
keyboard
mance
to
a
single
user
at
low
cost
and
usually
are
used
to
execute
third
party
soft
and
mouse
ware
also
called
shrink
wrap
software
desktop
computing
is
one
of
the
largest
markets
for
computers
and
the
evolution
of
many
computing
technologies
is
driven
by
this
class
of
computing
which
is
only
about
0
years
old
servers
are
the
modern
form
of
what
was
once
mainframes
minicomputers
server
a
computer
used
for
and
supercomputers
and
are
usually
accessed
only
via
a
network
servers
are
ori
running
larger
programs
for
ented
to
carrying
large
workloads
which
may
consist
of
either
single
complex
multiple
users
often
simulta
neously
and
typically
accessed
applications
usually
a
scientific
or
engineering
application
or
handling
many
only
via
a
network
small
jobs
such
as
would
occur
in
building
a
large
web
server
these
applications
are
often
based
on
software
from
another
source
such
as
a
database
or
simulation
system
but
are
often
modified
or
customized
for
a
particular
function
servers
are
built
from
the
same
basic
technology
as
desktop
computers
but
provide
for
greater
expa
ndability
of
both
computing
and
input
output
capacity
as
we
will
see
in
the
chapter
the
performance
of
a
server
can
be
measured
in
several
different
ways
depending
on
the
application
of
interest
in
general
servers
also
place
a
greater
emphasis
on
dependability
since
a
crash
is
usually
more
costly
than
it
would
be
on
a
single
user
desktop
computer
servers
span
the
widest
range
in
cost
and
capability
at
the
low
end
a

class
of
computers

highest

be
little

a
desktop
machine
without
a
screen
or
keyboard
and
with
formance
and
cost
they
are
a
cost
of
a
thousand
dollars
these
low
end
servers
are
typically
used
for
file

as
servers
