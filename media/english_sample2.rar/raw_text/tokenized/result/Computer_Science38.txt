this

uses
the

which
is
located
on
the

of
the
board
it
is
covered
by
a
set
of
metal

which
look
like
a

instruction

architecture
also
called
architecture
an
name
the
instruction
set

or
simply
architecture
of
a
machine
abstract

between

the
instruction

architecnlfe
includes
anything
programmers
need
to
know

and
the
lowest

of
a
machine
that
i

and
so
on
typically
the
operating
system
will
encapsulate
the

encompasses
all
the
information
necessary
to
write
a
machine
of
doing
i
o
allocating

and
other
low

system

so
that

programmers
do
not
need
to

is
called
the

ab

and
so
all
an
instruction
set
architecture
allows
computer
designers
to
talk
about
func
application
binary
interface
tions
independently
from
the
hardware
that
performs
them
for
example
we
can
abi
the
user
portion
of
the
talk
about
the
functions
of
a
digital
clock
keeping
time
displaying
the
time
set
instruction

plus
the
operat
ting
the
alarm
independently
from
the
clock
hardware

computer
designers
distinguish
architecture
from
an
application
programmers
implementation
of
an
architecture
along
the
same
lines
an
implementation
is
defines
a
standard
for
binary
hardwa
re
that
obeys
the
architecnlfe
abstraction
these
ideas
bring
us
to
