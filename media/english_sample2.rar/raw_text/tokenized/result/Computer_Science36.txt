a
plastic
board
shows
the

of
the
desktop
computer
in

this
motherboard
is
containing
packages

shown
vertically
on

appear
on
the
right
including
processor
cache
the
small
rectangles
on
the
motherboard
contain
the
devices
that
drive
our
va
memory
and
connectors
for
advancing
technology
integrated
circuits
or
chips
the
board
is
composed
of
devices
such
as
networks
and
three
pieces
the
piece
connecting
to
the
i

devices
mentioned
earlier
the
mem

ory
and
the
processor
the
i

devices
are
connected
via
the
two
large
boards
integrated
circuit
also
called
attached
perpendicularly
to
the
motherboard
toward
the
middle

the
memory
is
where
the
programs
are
kept
when
they
are
running
it
also

the
storage

in
contains
the
data
needed
by
the
running

in

memory
is
which
programs
are
kept
when
found
on
the
two
small
boards
that
are
attached
perpendicularly
toward
the
mid
they
are
running
and
that
con
dle
of
the
motherboard
each
small
memory
board
contains
eight
integrated
cir

needed
by
the

programs
the
processor
is
the

occasionally
people
call
the

also
called
