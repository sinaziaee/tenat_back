platters
and
the
read
write
heads
big
both
hardware
and
software
consist
of
hierarchical
layers
with
each
the
lower
layer
hiding
details
from
the
level
above
this
principle
of
abstrac
picture
tion
is
the
way
both
hardware
designers
and
software
designers
cope
with
the
complexity
of
computer
systems
one
key
interface
between
the
levels
of
abstraction
is
the
instruction
set
architecture
the
interface
between
the
hardware
and
low
level
software
this
abstract
interface
enables
many
implementations
of
varying
cost
and
performance
to
run
identical
