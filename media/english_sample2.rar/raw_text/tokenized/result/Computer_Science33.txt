the
original
mouse
was
electromechanical
and
used
a
large
ball
that
when
rolled
across
a
surface
would
cause
an
x
and
y
counter
to
be
incremented
the
amount
of
increase
in
each
counter
told
how
far
the
mouse
had
been
moved
the
electromechanical
mouse
has
largely
been
replaced
by
the
newer
all
optical
mouse
the
optical

is
actually
a

the

is
an

of
a

where
the

of

cause
