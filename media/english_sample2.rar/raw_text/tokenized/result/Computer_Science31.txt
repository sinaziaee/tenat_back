under
the
covers
the
final
advantage
is
that
programming
languages
allow
programs
to
be
inde
pendent
of
the
computer
on
which
they
were
developed
since
compilers
and
assemblers
can
translate
high
level
language
programs
to
the
binary
instructions
of
any
machine
these
three
advantages
are
so
strong
that
today
little
program
ming
is
done
in
assembly
language
under
the
covers
now
that
we
have
looked
below
your
program
to
uncover
the
underlying
software
let
s
open
the
covers
of
the
computer
to
learn
about
the
underlying
hardware
the
underlying
hardware
in
any
computer
performs
the
same
basic
functions
input
ting
data
outputting
data
processing
data
and
storing
data
how
these
functions
are
performed
is
the
primary
topic
of
this
book
and
subsequent
chapters
deal
with
different
parts
of
these
four
tasks
when
we
come
to
an
important
point
in
this
book
a
point
so
important
that
we
hope
you
will
remember
it
forever
we
emphasize
it
by
identifying
it
as
a
big
picture
item
we
have
about
a
dozen
big
pictures
in
this
book
with
the
first
being
the
five
components
of
a
computer
that
perform
the
tasks
of
inputting
outputting
processing
and
storing
data
big
the
five
classic
components
of
a
computer
are
input
output
memory
the
datapath
and
control
with
the
last
two
sometimes
combined
and
called
picture
the
processor
figure
shows
the
standard
organization
of
a
computer
this
organization
is
independent
of
hardware
technology
you
can
place
every
piece
of
every
computer
past
and
present
into
one
of
these
five
cat
egories
to
help
you
keep
all
this
in
perspective
the
five
components
of
a
computer
are
shown
on
the
front
page
of
the
following
chapters
with
the
portion
of
interest
to
that
chapter
highlighted
figure
shows
a
typical
desktop
computer
with
keyboard
mouse
screen
input
device
a
mechanism
through
which
the
computer
is
and
a
box
containing
even
more
hardware
what

information
such
as
the
is
a
network
that
connects
the
computer
to
other
computers
this

reveals
two
of
the
key
components
of
computers
input

such
as
the
key

and

devices
such
as

as
the
names
suggest

device
a
mechanism
that
conveys
the
result
ofa

feeds
the
computer
and
output
is
the
result
of
computation

to
the
user
